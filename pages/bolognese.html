    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 carrots grated</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 lb minced beef 500g</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon all spice or seven spices</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cans crushed tomatoes or tomato passata (each can should be 400 g or 12 oz)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>handful chopped basil leaves (or 1/2 teaspoon dried basil)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>pinch red chili flakes, optional</li>
        <li>1/2 cup non alcoholic red wine or beef broth, grape juice, water</li>
        <li>1 pack spaghetti, cooked al dente 400g (16oz)</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese for topping</li>
        <li>extra basil for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large heavy bottomed saucepan on medium heat, add the olive oil.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, add the onions, carrots, celery and garlic. Sautee, stirring regularly for about 10 minutes or until the vegetables have softened. If heat seems too high, reduce to medium low.</li>
        <li>Add the minced beef, the allspice, the garlic powder and a big pinch of salt and pepper, and cook beef until browned, breaking up any clumps that form with a wooden spoon. You may choose to drain the beef of its fat at this point.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, basil leaves, dried oregano, bay leaves, the beef stock cube, fennel seeds, red chili flakes, the beef stock cube, water/grape juice/or additional beef broth, and cherry tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hr to 1 hr 15 min.</li>
        <li>After 1 hour of cooking, check on seasoning and adjust as necessary. You should have a thick flavorful sauce. Remove the lid, and let the sauce continue to simmer for another 15-20 minutes for the liquid to reduce further.</li>
        <li>If you aren't anticipating any leftovers, you can toss the bolognese sauce directly with the cooked pasta. If you think you'll have anything leftover, I'd advise you just serve with some bolognese sauce on top. This way you can store the leftover bolognese sauce separately from the cooked pasta.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh parmesan and extra basil if desired.</li>
    </ol>
